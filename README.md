# GPA-Navigator-with-Exam-Prep-Companion-using-Python

This project is aimed at automating the calculation of students' Grade Point Averages (GPA) and providing insightful recommendations for Term End Exam (TEE) marks to enhance exam preparation. Developed for my University NMIMS School of Technology Management Engineering, CSE - Data Science branch.

Before running the program, please follow these steps:

1. Ensure Python is installed on your computer.

2. Open the code and locate line 7. Change the working directory to match your system's directory path. This ensures that the program saves data in the correct location.

   Example:
   os.chdir('/path/to/your/directory')
   
3. Locate line 268 and replace the CSV file name with your CSV file name in the same directory for recording data. The current setting is 'recorded_data.csv'.
